# Heatmap
This is a computer vision based project that generate a heat map video from an input video by the help of OpenCV and python.

This is a simple project that involves three processes.First is to apply the heat map filters to the frames of the video.
Second is to store all those frames or images to a directory and the third is to make a video from that stored images.

Note:- 1.You have to create a directory where you will store all the images and from that you have to generate the video.
      2. Give the code of the video type.Here I'm generating a .avi file so I've given 'DIVX' code.
